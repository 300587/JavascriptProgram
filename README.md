# JavascriptProgram

Use what you learn in the examples to write code in "PrintGreetings" that will cause the program to greet the world. Copy and paste each example to the programiz compiler and play around with it.

To test your code, copy and paste your code to https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/ Do not be discouraged! the best way to learn to code is by writing more code. Make changes and see what happens when you press "Run"

Notes:
Case matters. Make sure you are not using upper case when you should be using lower case. 

console.log ("Hello World") //will print Hello World

Console.log ("Hello World") //will give you an error

If you want to define a variable, use var. Using const will give you a constant that cannot be assigned a new value.

var x=5;

const a=5;

Both of these hold the value of 5, but x can be reassigned since it's a var:

x=2;

Notice how num1 and NUM1 are two separate variables:

var  num1=5;

var  NUM1=55;

Watch out for spaces and extra characters. This statement has a space between num and 1

var num 1=5;

This statement gets rid off the space but has a comma before the semicolon that will cause an error.

var num1=5,;


Make sure you include closing parenthesis:

console.log ("Hello World" 

will give you an error
